## My Story

I'm Matt, a software engineer with a focus on distributed systems. I am deeply motivated by enabling engineering teams move faster, safer. My dream is to become a technical co-founder. Currently building amazing things at Asana.

Before Asana, I worked at HOVER. During my time there, I was the technical lead for a team of ten engineers. We took a new product from conception to market, unlocking two new revenue streams for the company. We built a culture of refactoring, small moves and continuous deployments.

Prior to HOVER, I was at Darby Smart, an early stage social media company that was later acquired. As a fullstack engineer, I migrated our backbone frontend to server rendered react with a 60% increased PageSpeed score. Since there were only five engineers when I joined, I had a hand in all parts of the tech stack.

In a previous life, I worked as a UX designer at MeridianLink, building mortgage loan origination software.
